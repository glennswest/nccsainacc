### Usage
Use openbuids tnuts to hold the part into tracks on the extrusion.
Move the bit to home, then put the bracket in contact on both sides
with bit. Use the largest bit you intend to use when doing this.
Home the machine before cut, and then move off 10mm on x and y, and
set your work home. Optional, use nylon bolts so even if you cut into it, you do not break bits.
